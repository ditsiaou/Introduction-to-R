Chapter 5
What's a data frame?

# Print out built-in R data frame
mtcars 

Quick, have a look at your dataset
# Call head() on mtcars
head(mtcars)

Have a look at the structure

# Investigate the structure of mtcars
str(mtcars)


Creating a data frame

# Definition of vectors
name <- c("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", 
          "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", 
          "Uranus", "Neptune")
type <- c("Terrestrial planet", 
          "Terrestrial planet", 
          "Terrestrial planet", 
          "Terrestrial planet", "Gas giant", 
          "Gas giant", "Gas giant", "Gas giant")
diameter <- c(0.382, 0.949, 1, 0.532, 
              11.209, 9.449, 4.007, 3.883)
rotation <- c(58.64, -243.02, 1, 1.03, 
              0.41, 0.43, -0.72, 0.67)
rings <- c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)

# Create a data frame from the vectors
planets_df <- data.frame(name, type, diameter, rotation, rings)
#planets_df


Creating a data frame (2)

# Check the structure of planets_df
str(planets_df)


Selection of data frame elements

# The planets_df data frame from the previous exercise is pre-loaded
planets_df
# Print out diameter of Mercury (row 1, column 3)
planets_df[1,3]

# Print out data for Mars (entire fourth row)
planets_df[4,]

Selection of data frame elements (2)

# The planets_df data frame from the previous exercise is pre-loaded

# Select first 5 values of diameter column
planets_df[1:5,"diameter"]


Only planets with rings

# planets_df is pre-loaded in your workspace

# Select the rings variable from planets_df
rings_vector <- planets_df[,"rings"]
  
# Print out rings_vector
rings_vector


Only planets with rings (2)

# planets_df and rings_vector are pre-loaded in your workspace

# Adapt the code to select all columns for planets with rings
planets_df[rings_vector, ]


Only planets with rings but shorter

# planets_df is pre-loaded in your workspace

# Select planets with diameter < 1
subset(planets_df, diameter < 1)


Sorting


# Play around with the order function in the console
a <- c(134567, 1567890, 3456)
order(a)
a[order(a)]


Sorting your data frame

# planets_df is pre-loaded in your workspace

# Use order() to create positions
positions <- order(planets_df$diameter)
positions
# Use positions to sort planets_df
planets_df[positions, ]
